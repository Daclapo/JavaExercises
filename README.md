## Description

This repository encompasses a wide range of exercises designed to enhance my programming skills in Java. The exercises cover various topics, including:

- Object-oriented programming principles
- Exception handling
- Multithreading and concurrency
- Database access and manipulation
- File handling
- Data structures and algorithms
- ...

Each exercise is structured to reflect the learning objectives of the curriculum and includes source code, explanations, and any relevant documentation.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to acknowledge my first-year *Programación* and second-year *Acceso a Datos* teacher, José Luis López, as most of these exercises were provided by him as part of the DAM curriculum. His guidance and thoughtful approach to problem-solving greatly supported my understanding of Java and software development.

Additionally, I would like to thank my *Programación de Servicios y Procesos* teacher, Ana María Alonso, for providing the exercises in the **Multithreading** directory.

## Getting Started

To work with this repository, you can clone it to your local machine and start exploring the exercises.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Use the following command to clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Daclapo/JavaExercises.git
cd JavaExercises
```

### Step 2: Running Exercises
#### · Compiling all the .java files
Each exercise typically includes a main class or method to execute. Navigate to the relevant directory and compile the Java files as needed.

```bash
javac *.java
java MainClassName
```
or moving to de specific .java file and compiling it
```bash
cd Colections/ut08/ejercicios/ejercicio05/Ejercicio05.java
javac Ejercicio05.java
java Ejercicio05.class
```

#### · Opening the exercises with an IDE

You can open the exercises in your favorite IDE, such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans. Simply import the project as a Maven project and you will be ready to start.

1. Open your IDE.
2. Select the option to import an existing project.
3. Navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository.
4. Select the `pom.xml` file to import the Maven project.
5. Follow the IDE instructions to complete the import.

Once imported, you can explore and run the exercises directly from the IDE.
