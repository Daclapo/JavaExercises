# Java Exercises

Welcome! This repository is a compilation of Java exercises from my **_Grado Superior en Desarrollo de Aplicaciones Multiplataformas_** program at [IES Clara del Rey](https://iesclaradelrey.es/), along with independently developed projects. These works showcase my learning and growth in Java programming and software development principles.

---

## Description

This repository includes a broad selection of exercises designed to strengthen core Java programming skills and deepen understanding of software development principles. The exercises cover a range of essential topics, including:

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Principles of OOP, such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, applied to create modular and reusable code.
- **Error and Exception Handling:** Techniques for identifying, managing, and recovering from errors to build robust and fault-tolerant applications.
- **Concurrency and Multithreading:** Concepts and practices in managing concurrent processes and threads, ensuring efficient execution and resource-sharing.
- **Data Management and Persistence:** Techniques for accessing, manipulating, and persisting data in databases using JDBC and other data-access frameworks.
- **File I/O Operations:** Working with file input/output streams, serialization, and handling data files such as XML files for practical application needs.

Each exercise is organized to align with the curriculum's learning objectives and includes source code, explanations, and relevant documentation.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to acknowledge my first-year *Programación* and second-year *Acceso a Datos* teacher, José Luis López, as most of these exercises were provided by him as part of the DAM curriculum. His guidance and thoughtful approach to problem-solving greatly supported my understanding of Java and software development.

Additionally, I would like to thank my *Programación de Servicios y Procesos* teacher, Ana María Alonso, for providing the exercises in the **Multithreading** directory.

## Getting Started

To work with this repository, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8 or higher.
An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans.

### Installation


Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Daclapo/JavaExercises.git
cd JavaExercises
```
Import the project into your preferred IDE as a Maven project.

### Running Exercises


You can open the exercises in your favorite IDE, such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans. Simply import the project as a Maven project and you will be ready to start.

1. Open your IDE.
2. Select the option to import an existing project.
3. Navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository.
4. Select the `pom.xml` file to import the Maven project.
5. Follow the IDE instructions to complete the import.

Once imported, you can explore and run and build the exercises and projects directly from the IDE.

If not you can also;

Compile all the Java files in a directory:
```bash
 javac *.java
```

Run a specific main class:
```bash
java MainClassName
```

Alternatively, compile and run a specific Java file:
```bash
cd Colections/ut08/ejercicios/ejercicio05/
javac Ejercicio05.java
java Ejercicio05
```
